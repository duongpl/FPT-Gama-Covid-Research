/***
* Name: Aspects
* Author: Benoit Gaudou
* Description: This model details the various possibility of agent's drawing in an aspect.
* In particular, it attempts to answer questions such as:
* 1. how to display agents using geometries ? text ? images ?
* 2. how to display them in 3D ? with texture ? taken into account the light ?
* 3. how to display the link between 2 agents ?
* 4. how to deal with transparency in agents ?
* 5. how to focus on some agents ?
* 
* Tags: aspect, 3D, draw, transparency, focus

		// and the aspect big_circle_with_transparency that draws all of them with a big circle with a transparency depending on the agent.
